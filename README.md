# Athlete App Independent Study

As the end of the Fall 2020 semester was wrapping up and we were looking at classes
for the Spring 2021 semester, we began talking about the possibility of doing an independent
study. We wanted to gain both interesting and practical experience that we were struggling to
find in the courses offered. The idea of learning how to build mobile applications was a hit
amongst ourselves, so we began thinking about the formalities of receiving an independent
study such as getting a faculty adviser. Having all worked closely with Professor Sakib Miazi in
his Data Structures class, we decided to reach out to him. We presented the idea to Professor
Miazi who excitedly accepted his role as our potential faculty adviser. From here, we went
through the necessary steps to apply for the independent study such as creating a detailed
syllabus outlining the course content, assigned readings, and evaluation procedures and
submitting this course overview to Dr. Carl Yerger, the math and computer science department
chair, for review and eventually acceptance.

Our independent study, named the Athlete App Independent study, is built around the
goal of learning how to develop hybrid mobile applications and ultimately building an app that
Davidson coaches and athletes can use to track specific metrics such as hours of sleep,
stress/anxiety, soreness/fatigue, etc. The purpose for this application is to close the gap
between coaches and athletes, giving the coaches a better understanding of what their athletes
need and when they need it.
To be able to develop this app, we needed to learn the basics of HTML and JavaScript which
are the framework of React Native, the mobile application development software that we would
be using. We used Code Academy, an interactive online coding platform, to build small projects
using HTML and JavaScript that enhanced our skills and understanding of these languages.
Once we had a solid foundation in these two languages, we began our journey of learning React
Native with an online Udemy course, The Complete React Native + Hooks Course. This course
allowed us to follow along and create different React Native apps to learn the key skills needed
to successfully develop mobile apps and more specifically our athlete app. Along the way, we
built several very cool applications such as a restaurant search app that incorporated the Yelp
API, allowing us to search for restaurants nearby categorized by price and quality. With our
mobile application development tool kit full, we embarked on our journey of building the athlete
app, Kumo Metrics (kumo is cloud in Japanese).
Motivation

Our app, one that collects and records an athleteâ€™s metrics over the course of a year or
season, was born from John Young, the Davidson College swimming head coach, and his love
for data. As the head coach of the swim team, and being someone who loves tracking metrics,
